Chrome browser fix for Recreation.gov
=====================

For many months now (Jul-2018) [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/) website has had an annoying bug with Chrome. The footer is stuck in the middle of the page preventing users from making reservations and reading content. The fix is very simple, but obviously there is no rush to implement it.
This extension solves the problem in the meantime.

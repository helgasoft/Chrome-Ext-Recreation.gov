# Chrome browser fix for Recreation.gov

For many months now (Jul 2018) [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/) website has had an annoying bug with desktop Chrome. The footer is stuck in the middle of the page preventing users from making reservations and reading content. The fix is very simple, but obviously there is no rush to implement it.
This extension solves the problem in the meantime.
<br />*Note: Chrome on mobile and Firefox are not affected by this bug.*
